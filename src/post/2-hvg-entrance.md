[Hunter Valley Gardens](https://www.huntervalleygardens.com.au) is a really large theme park sized garden built by Bill and Imelda Roche over four years with a dedicated team of over 40 landscape gardeners, architects and engineers.

There are eight kilometres of walking paths winding through 14 hectares of gardens consisting of over 6000 trees, 600,000 shrubs and over 1 million ground cover plants, plus waterfalls, statues, murals and much more. The 10 individually themed gardens showcase the artistry of gardens around the world and use both native and exotic varieties of plants.
