[Cafe Enzo](https://www.enzohuntervalley.com.au/cafe) is praised for itâ€™s unique ambience and enchanting courtyard. Established since 1996, Cafe Enzo offers excellent coffee, food and service making it a must do when visiting the Hunter Valley. Set in the Tuscan inspired Peppers Creek Village in the heart of the Hunter Valley. Breakfast here was really delicious, will definitely come again.
