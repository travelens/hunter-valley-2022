Our NSW issued COVID-19 travel voucher of $50 was expiring soon, so we hurriedly booked a trip to the Hunter Valley. We wanted to revisit the Hunter Valley Gardens, because we haven't been for a few years. We also stopped at Kurri Kurri on the way, and visited Winmark to see sculptures on the second day.
