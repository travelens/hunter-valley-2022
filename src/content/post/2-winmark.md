[Winmark Wines](https://www.winmarkwines.com.au/) was established long ago in the premium soils of the Broke Fordwich area originally as the renowned Pooles Rock vineyard,. The 130 acre property is now home to 30 acres of premium chardonnay vines nestled below Yellow Rock and capturing the mountain breezes and spectacular views.

After a prosporous period of producing Pooles Rock wines, the property was sold and this little gem of a  hunter valley vineyard was left neglected for five years before Karin Adcock purchased the estate and lovingly restored the property and vines back to their premium status under the brand of Winmark Wines (‘Winmark”’ in Karin’s native Danish means “Fields of Wines”).

The blocks were carefully replaced with French root stock to supplement the reputation the vineyard had. The vines grow in well-drained, rich soil over a gravel/shale base. It is a must see on your hunter valley vineyards tour list.

With a rich viticultural history dating back to 1972, the former Pooles Rock property continues its remarkable revival under Karin Adcock. Together with the highly skilled team of wine experts, Viticulturalist Liz Riley, International wine consultant John Belsham along with Xanthe Hatcher in the winery, who lend their expertise to Winmark Wines ensuring the road from the vines to the glass is optimised.

## SCULPTURE WALK

“Wine and Sculpture both age well”, David Ball. Winmark Wines Owner and Vigneron Karin Adcock is an avid collector of art and sculptures and David Ball’s monumental Biosis was the first of many sculptures to find their home at Winmark.

We explored the property to look at the various sculptures, including the red Portals of Illusion, Lollipops, Celest and Fight or Flight sculptures. Some of them, like Bronze Flower and Field of Aggies, are set against the natural landmarks of the property.
