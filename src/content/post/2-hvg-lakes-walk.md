This is one of the more secluded areas of the Gardens, its waterways are lined by perennial borders that are full of colour throughout the year with plantings of seasonal annuals and spring flowering trees and shrubs.

Surrounded by approximately one and a half kilometres of pathways, the Lakes Walk is the backdrop for the stunning Hunter Valley Gardens Chapel and home to the Lakes Rotunda, both very popular for wedding ceremonies.
