The Italian Grotto is home to a statue of Saint Francis of Assisi (patron saint of animals and the environment) and is lined with red Bougainvillea, pink Wisteria and cascading Geraniums, Pelargoniums, and many other hidden delights. In the style of a true Italian garden there are edible plants including lemon, orange, olive trees, lavender and herbs which help evoke the fragrance of Italy.
