Enter through 180-year-old antique Indian Gates guarded by bronze elephants, to wind our way through a Lilly Pilly hedge discovering a superb mosaic of ground covering plants and pebbles and a contemporary garden design featuring Purple Ajuga and Variegated Dwarf Agapanthus.

We enjoyed the Indian Tea House finely crafted with traditional Indian embellishments – the perfect shady spot to enjoy views of this garden and its topiary elephants.
