Intricate floral beds within manicured box hedging designed to reflect the classic French Parterre style of garden, the Border Garden is surrounded by intertwined hedges of Hill’s Weeping figs, an Australian native, with European boxwood used to create interesting shapes.

This garden incorporates several hand-carved Indian marble water features and statues representing the Four Seasons – a signature garden and a place of romance and elegance. We can stroll along the pathways through the garden or take in the sights from above on the viewing platform.
