One of the more diverse feature gardens, the Sunken Garden contains an array of evergreen and deciduous trees along with shrubs and flowers that offer beautiful vistas all year round.

Enjoy the pathways framed by hundreds of roses and take in the spectacular view from the pergola at the top of the waterfall.

The Sunken Garden features a majestic 10 metre high waterfall and garden beds ablaze with the colours of magnificent annual displays.
