Crossing green Chinese slate, visitors enter the Chinese Garden through a traditional Moon Gate flanked by two bronze Temple Guardians. Incorporating traditional elements of rugged rocks, raked decorative gravels and slow growing grass, this garden features Conifers, Camellia Sasanqua, Azaleas, Bamboo and many edible fruits including Cumquats, Mulberries and Persimmons.
