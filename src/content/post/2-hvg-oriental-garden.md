The Oriental Garden is heavily influenced by Japanese and Korean gardens, and is a place of harmony, balance, and serenity.

This garden is precisely trimmed and manicured with natural curves to make it flow amidst its surroundings.

The carp can be viewed from the pergola and there are often turtles that love to sunbake on the rocks.
