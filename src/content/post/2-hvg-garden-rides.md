Rides include:

- Tea cup - join the tea party at the fantastic Tea Cup ride. Twist, twirl and have fun in giant coloured tea cups.
- Ferris wheel - see the Gardens from 25 metres up in our spectacular Ferris Wheel. The view from the top across the wineries, Gardens and mountain ranges has to be seen to be believed.
- Carousel - experience the beautiful traditional Venetian Carousel, this feature was made in Italy to Hunter Valley Garden's design.
- Swing Chair - the flying Swing Chair adds a classic carnival feel to the Gardens. Feel the wind in the hair and get the adrenalin pumping as it flies 11 metres above the ground.
- Superslide - this slide is a massive 35 metres long, 12 metres high and a whole lot of fun!
