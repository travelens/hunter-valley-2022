One of the largest of its type in Australia, the Formal Garden is influenced by the garden designs of France and England. This garden is bordered by Manchurian Pear Trees with their beautiful white flowers and dramatic bronze foliage in Autumn. Features include a variety of topiary and finely manicured lawns, specimen trees of evergreen Magnolia Grandiflora Little Gem and 3000 bushes of Chameleon roses.

We also saw some Christmas light decorations here.
